# Text-Mining

Text mining, also known as text analytics or natural language processing (NLP), is a process of extracting valuable insights, patterns, and information from unstructured text data. Unstructured text data includes any textual information that is not organized in a structured format, such as books, articles, social media posts, customer reviews, emails, and more. Text mining techniques involve various tasks like text preprocessing, tokenization, entity recognition, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis, among others. The primary goal of text mining is to transform unstructured text into structured data that can be analyzed to gain insights, make data-driven decisions, and discover hidden patterns.

# Sentimental Analysis

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subset of text mining that focuses on determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as a review, comment, or social media post. It involves classifying the text as positive, negative, neutral, or sometimes more granular sentiments like happy, sad, angry, etc. Sentiment analysis uses various techniques, including natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning, to automatically assess and quantify the emotional tone or sentiment conveyed in the text. This analysis is valuable in applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, market research, and brand reputation management, as it helps organizations understand public opinions and customer sentiments towards their products, services, or topics of interest.
